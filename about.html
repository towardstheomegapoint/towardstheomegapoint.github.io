        <p id="text2">Towards the Omega Point speculates on a scenario where humankind evolved to collectivize thought. In this alternative reality, humanity has already surpassed the state of primal individualism: human beings consider the collective wellbeing and the ultimate goal of the species in every thought, action, movement and decision they make. <br>
The advancement of humanity is headed towards the Omega Point—a moment of convergence of every mind and every body.<br>
In this society there’s no place for feelings like guilt, because guilt is a consequence of an individualistic behaviour: feeling like you’ve subjugated another human being, putting yourself above them, even if unconsciously.<br>
Those feelings are counterproductive to the advancement of humanity, this psychological evolution also altered human biology: individuals developed a negative feedback mechanism which, by generating pain, stops those feelings immediately. If it persists, this mechanism can lead to death. Each human is a unit. No one is unreplaceable.<br>
Would the world worry about you?
