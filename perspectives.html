    <p id="text2">Even though Towards the Omega Point was a group project, each of us developed individual perspectives on different dimensions of the fiction. <br> Our approach was not to take detours from the main narrative but instead to add layers of significance and expand subjects we found worthy of expansion: politics, justice and faith. <br> We believe those areas of human culture would be the most affected by a complete shift from individualism to collectivism, so three individual videos were created, each stemming from a personal approach to those subjects and how they would exist in society.

         <p id="text3">“I still dream of organon. I wake up crying.” sings Kate Bush in Cloudbusting (1985),from the perspective of Wilhelm Reich’s son. Reich was an Austrian investigator who theorised about the orgon: a vital energy that is responsible from creating organisation structures at various
levels.
This is the starting point for the analysis of how politics — the organization and maintenance of citizens, states and public services — exist in a society which evolved into having each individual think of the collective well-being rather than about their individual desires. This framework poses many questions: would Governments exist? What would be their role? How would this society keep itself on the track of collective evolution? The utopian easily turns totalitarian: organisms possess secret information which is kept from the masses. Through an informative delivery, this video speculates about this alternative universe by building bridges that connect it to ours. What would be of frontiers, borders, figures of authority and power in an absolutely collectivistic society? All those manifestations establish relations with politics, given that they are indexes of different modes of organisation. 
The choice of having three languages (English, Chinese and Spanish) which narrate these facts is due to the fact that they are the three most spoken in our world. Evolution, in this society, could’ve led to a dissolution of all other languages.
This perspective presents, then, relations between reality and fiction. It introduces informations which are external to this alternative reality and come from ours, which contextualise the pertinence of the fiction within cultural, social, political and scientific  questions.
It’s a dream of organization.

         <p id="text3">Human evolution is no longer just biological, happening now also at the psychological and social level. This continuous transformation slowly converges towards an ultimate level of human consciousness: the Omega Point. This extreme state equates to the abolishment of all insecurities and uncertainties, of every individualistic feeling. Every soul becomes one: a single, collective consciousness. The end of loneliness. The human race will be a single remaining element and will function in perfect harmony with the Earth, with the universe. All will be beautiful and sublime when no individual interests exist, when there’s no guilt nor need to subjugate the other. This video speculates about the mind space, the beliefs, faith and hope of these society’s individuals by presenting the almost collective ecstasy that makes every individual base their decisions solely on the wellbeing of the collective and never on their own.

         <p id="text4">It is consensual among scholars that a society which aspires to become universally fair and equalitarian depends on a fairly centralized justice device. 
This dependency is largely justified by human nature’s tendency to conflict. Even though humanity’s evolutionary success was based in human’s keenness no collaborate between them, our kind continued exhibiting manifestations of violence among members of the same species.
MMA combats, african Dambe and street fights showcase three different ways in which the human being deals with its primitive violent instinct and also how these three types of violence shine a light on a primordial and decentralized way to “make justice”.
